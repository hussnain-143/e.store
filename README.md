## Project Structure

This project follows the App Router convention of Next.js 13+, with pages and components organized as follows:

* `app/page.js`: The main homepage of the application.
* `app/layout.js`: Defines the root layout, including shared components like the `Header` and `Footer`.
* `components/`: Contains reusable React components such as `Header.jsx` and `Footer.jsx`.
* `public/`: Static assets like images.
You can start editing pages by modifying files within the `app/` directory.

## Key Features

* **Modern Next.js 13+ Architecture:** Built with the App Router for improved performance and flexibility.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS.
* **Dynamic Navigation:** Features a comprehensive header with active link highlighting and a mobile-friendly menu.
* **Structured Footer:** A detailed footer providing quick links, legal information, contact details, and social media integration.
* **Optimized Fonts:** Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a high-performance font family for Vercel.
* **React Icons:** Leverages `react-icons` for scalable and customizable SVG icons across the application.
